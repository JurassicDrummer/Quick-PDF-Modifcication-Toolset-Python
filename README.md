# Quick-PDF-Modifcication-Toolset-Python
A simple and fast way of modifying the order of a PDF and combine multiple PDF files together. You can also rotate and remove pages with another script. It was designed to be used with a shortcut that you can attach in your start menu. It is coded in Python and was created to be the fastest most efficient way of completing an action with a pdf.

# Instructions - Setup
There is a variable called "initialdir" which you can set to the default location that you want the file manager to open every time the program is run.
I have seperated the individual functions for removing a page, combining PDFs and rotating specific PDF pages. I did this as I find that I usually end up only needing to do one of these functions, and seperating them allows less options to be displayed.
